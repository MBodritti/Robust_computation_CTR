# LIST OF DATASET USED:

   1.	**Montgomery and Shenzhen dataset** _[S. Jaeger, S. Candemir, S. Antani et al., “Two public chest x-ray datasets for computer-aided screen-
ing of pulmonary diseases,” Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery, vol. 4, no. 6, 2014]_
   2. **JSRT dataset** _[J. Shiraishi et al., “Development of a digital image database for chest radiographs with and without a lung nodule,” American Journal of Roentgenology, vol. 174, no. 1.]_ **with corresponding manually generated anatomical masks** _[B. van Ginneken et al., “Segmentation of
anatomical structures in chest radiographs using supervised methods: a comparative study on a public database,” Medical Image Analysis, vol. 10, no. 1, 2006]_.
   3. **CheXpert dataset** _[ J. Irvin et al., “Chexpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison,” in Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, vol. 33, 2019]_. A subset of the CheXpert dataset was selected: images labelled as positive to cardiomegaly and enlarged cardiomediastinum were excluded, resulting in 25,369 CXRs with theoretically normal values of CTRs, formed by 34\% female and 66\% male, from 18 to 90-year-old.
   5.	**Wingspan dataset** _[N. Dong et al., “Unsupervised domain adaptation for automatic estimation of cardiothoracic ratio,” in MICCAI, 2018]_
