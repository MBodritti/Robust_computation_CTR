# LIST OF DATASET USED:

   1.	**Montgomery and Shenzhen dataset** [1].
   2. **JSRT dataset** [2]  **with corresponding manually generated anatomical masks** [3].
   3.	**Wingspan dataset** [4].
   4. **CheXpert dataset** [5]. A subset of the CheXpert dataset was selected: images labelled as positive to cardiomegaly and enlarged cardiomediastinum were excluded, resulting in 25,369 CXRs with theoretically normal values of CTRs, formed by 34\% female and 66\% male, from 18 to 90-year-old.
